# Node.js Practice Projects

Welcome to the **Node.js Practice Projects** repository. This repo contains a collection of personal projects showcasing various interesting concepts, techniques, and applications using Node.js. Each project focuses on different aspects of Node.js, from API development to real-time applications, file handling, and more.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository follows a **one-folder-per-project** structure, making it easy to navigate and explore each project individually. Each project folder typically includes:

- **Source Code**: Core project files and implementation.
- **package.json**: Project dependencies and scripts.
- **Documentation**: README or notes with a description of the project and usage instructions.
- **Examples**: Sample usage or test files (if applicable).

## Running Projects

Each project may have a different setup. Please refer to the specific README.md file in each project folder for detailed instructions.

### For Simple Scripts

If the project is a simple script, you can run it directly using:

```
node filename.js
```

### For Projects with Dependencies

If the project has a package.json file, install the dependencies first:

```
npm install
```

Then run the project using the appropriate command (check the README.md or package.json scripts):

```
npm start
# or
npm run dev
```
