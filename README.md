# Node.js Practice Projects

Welcome to the **Node.js Practice Projects** repository. This repo contains a collection of personal projects showcasing various interesting concepts, techniques, and applications using Node.js. Each project focuses on different aspects of Node.js, from API development to real-time applications, file handling, and more.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized with a **one-folder-per-project** structure, making it easy to navigate and explore each project individually. Each folder contains the project's code, package.json file, documentation (maybe), and, where applicable, example usage instructions.

## Getting Started

To run the examples, make sure you have Node.js installed. Clone this repository and run each file with: `node filename.js `
